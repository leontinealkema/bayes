    "text": "All code for this course will be made available in a public repository (repo) on Github: https://github.com/AlkemaLab/BayesCode.\nWe will use the open-source software R for analyses and computations, through its user-friendly interface R-studio (https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). For model fitting, R packages and extensions are used such that all analyses take place in R. Analysis scripts will be provided for example analyses and discussed in recordings.\nThe remainder of this page contains a workflow for non-Github users, and some resources if you’d like to brush up on your R skills."
